<b><u>_ 2073 year. Spring. _</u></b> 
<br><br></p>
	  <p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In secret laboratories of the USI ( «United States of Israel» ) Ministry of Defense, work was in full swing on developing systemic solutions for expanding and altering personal qualities through modifications to brain and memory functions. Government agencies are aware of numerous projects in this area among private companies, monitoring advanced processes and regulating interactions. The latest developments are not available to the public, but various neurochips and implants connected to the global network are already in circulation.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Rival transnational corporations are trying to buy out the best agents and hackers to stay ahead in this race and, at the most critical moment, deal a crushing blow to their opponents.<br>
Sometimes, those who, for one reason or another, do not want to take sides find themselves caught up in these confrontations.<br>
<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The international conglomerate UNERO ( «United Neurocybernetics Educational & Research Organization» ) was originally engaged in the study of brain metabolism and the emulation of processes occurring at this level. By combining new nanomaterials from carbon composites, it became possible to create more sensitive implants and significantly improve the quality of medical services. In addition, the projects involved research and modeling of artificial nerve tissue to create intelligent machines based on nucleic acids.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	This spring, UNERO internal intelligence reports revealed information about an unknown hacker who managed to penetrate the sacred realm of the corporate body and steal a database of secret developments. Security agents called in special units and AI detectives, calculating the hacker's location and identity. The next stage involved a rapid response — any delay could prove to be an unforgivable risk.<br><br>



<b><u>_ The morning of March 9. _ </u></b>
<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Boris was a stately man in his fifties, with a slight receding hairline, thick black eyebrows, and a sharp Greek nose. He did not like to talk much, distinguished by his calm and firm character, capable of making sometimes harsh but always carefully considered judgments and quickly making decisions in difficult situations. In fact, as befits the deputy head of intelligence in a large campaign. But in the situation that had developed the day before, even he could not hide the excitement that was running through his body. Sweat was already beginning to gather on his forehead. He was thinking very hard, realizing how quickly time was passing.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	In the background of the office was a large LCD monitor broadcasting a report on the latest incidents in cybercrime. The information about what had happened had not yet leaked to the press.<br>
	The contact stick (an universal intercom) lying on the marble table beeped softly. Boris raised his head and snapped his fingers:<br>
- “We're here, boss,” - came the reply from the speaker.<br>
- “Come in.”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The automatic armored glass doors silently slid open. Two men entered the office; one tall, thin, and bald, wearing a wrinkled gray coat; the other with long curly hair, stocky and muscular, wearing a fashionable vest with gold buttons. They approached the table silently. With hand gestures, Boris opened interactive files with information on the table without looking up at his interlocutors. The newcomers, in turn, tried to concentrate, which was clearly difficult for them. A tense pause hung in the air.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- “An intruder has penetrated the internal network,” - said the boss, - “...he managed to hack both firewalls and bypass the first-level monitoring system, although it is still unclear how he got to the database in the storage facility, which is cut off from external servers... However, that's not your job,” - he finally looked up at his guests, his face twitching with emotion — “...this guy stole from the wrong people...”<br>
An emotionally abrupt gesture brought up a virtual window with a photo and a brief dossier on top of the others.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- “According to our information, he rents an apartment alone in the old district of Shuk-City... It's difficult to check these places, which is why you were hired... ” - Boris narrowed his predatory gaze. - “You know your job, and it's preferable to do it without unnecessary noise. As usual, the pay is higher for a live target than for a dead one. I don't recommend getting carried away — the subject may be dangerous. All other necessary information will be sent to your personal routephone. Any questions?”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- “... And did he steal a lot?” — asked the curly-haired muscleman, looking at the photo.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boss nervously scratched his eyebrow:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - “Less than necessary, but more than possible...”<br><br>



<b><u>_ The evening of March 11. _ </u></b>
<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Shuk-City was located a few miles outside the city. It was an old district, if not ancient — some of the buildings there had survived the technological revolution. Mold-covered superstructures enveloped kilometers of crumbling slums. It was home to nonconformists, technoliberal communities, hermits, various gangsters, and simply the dregs of society. For many years, the authorities tried to bring order there, but each time they encountered fierce resistance and, as a result, suffered losses among both the civilian population and their own units. As a result, the groups dividing the territory among themselves only strengthened their control and influence, and none of the party leaders dared to push through the planned project to demolish and completely rebuild the neighborhood. Thus, the area acquired a kind of autonomy and was practically cut off from the main infrastructure of the city. Only the most essential functions remained, such as the water supply, sewage system, electric generator, and a couple of old-style communication base stations, all built before the revolution. Everything was held together by a thread and worked intermittently. Corruption may have played a role in this. Overall, it's a great place to lay low or buy something on the black market.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	It was already getting dark outside when a car with license plates unusual for this area appeared. Slowing down its miniature F-class thermonuclear engine and lowering its anti-gravity cushions, a car circled the winding, narrow streets of the red-light district, stopping at an inconspicuous residential building on the corner and turning off its headlights.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The two men were sitting in the car; the bald one, still wearing the same coat, and the curly-haired one, who had replaced his fashionable vest with a black raincoat. The first one was grunting excitedly, trying to crush the scattered cocaine crystals on a small mobile mirror, while the second one was looking puzzled out the side window, sticking his hand out with a lit joint. A limping cyborg slowly crossed the street, flashing an old-model implant sticking out of his collarbone.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Taking drag, the curly-haired man discovered that his joint had gone out. He reached for his lighter, glanced indifferently at his companion, and, poking at the glowing hologram of the eomaga (electro-optical car radio), turned on some heavy metal. The space was filled with the sounds of a roaring electric guitar. The bald man waved his hand nervously, changing the style of music to a fast electronic beat, without taking his eyes off the mirror in his other hand. After waiting a couple of seconds, the second guy switched the eomaga back to metal. Finally dealing with the crumbs on the mirror, the bald guy greedily sucked them into himself, and after scratching his nose, he turned on the rhythmic trance again. Taking a slow drag, the curly-haired guy looked calmly at his friend.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - “Damn neighborhood, old believers are unpredictable people...” - he said, - “Mick, are you sure he's alone there?”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - “Of course I'm sure, fuck... But wait, aren't we getting the same information? ... Then how the fuck can I be sure of anything?”<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Curly sniffed guiltily.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - “And one more thing,” - continued the bald man, - “just a reminder, let's not use names there, okay? Come on, time is ticking...”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	They got out of the car and opened the trunk. One took a hunting knife and a metal rod, deftly hiding them under his coat, while the other slung a black backpack over his shoulder.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	The kitchen was slightly messy; there were unwashed dishes in the sink, an open jar of peanuts, and a half-eaten piece of bread. A young girl with a fragile build and poor posture was opening a can of tuna. Nearby, a mature cat and a young kitten rubbed against her legs, anticipating the treats being prepared. She poured the contents into a plate, licked her fingers, and took a can of tomatoes from the white cabinet above. Suddenly, the doorbell rang, interrupting everyone's attention.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - “Who is it?” - she asked, wiping her hands on her jeans and heading for the door.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - “Delivery service!” - came the reply from the other side.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	The young lady looked through the peephole and saw a handsome, curly-haired gentleman with an innocent look and a backpack typical of couriers.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - “Um, I didn't order anything,” - she began by open the door slightly, without removing the chain.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	A lightning-fast blow to the door followed, knocking the chain off and throwing the girl to the floor, scaring the cats. Two men entered, closing the door behind them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - “Who are you, what do you want?!” - she screamed, crawling backward.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - “Where is he?” - the bald man muttered as he approached.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	The girl squealed in fear. The man shushed her in response, pressing his finger to lips and threateningly unsheathing a knife.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - “Where's your friend?” - he repeated.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - “He... went out to the store...”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	The mercenaries exchanged glances.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - “What the hell, Mick? What do we do now?” - asked the second one.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - “You damn bastard, we agreed - no names!”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	The other man pursed his lips guiltily, spreading his hands.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - “Okay, maybe he'll see her and talk faster... Tie this bitch up.”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	Curly walked over to the bag and pulled out some rope and a rag.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	After a while, it got completely dark outside. Sitting down on the sofa and unbuttoning his coat, the man thoughtfully rummaged through his pockets. Finally, he pulled out a handful of pistachios mixed with tobacco and began to separate them. Opposite him, a bound girl with a gag in her mouth sat on a chair.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	In the kitchen, a second companion shuffled around, scaring away a cat that had just begun to approach a plate of tuna. He slammed the cupboards discontentedly and cursed quietly, trying to find something edible. Then he pulled out several sliding shelves, stumbling upon open potato chips and a couple of chocolate snacks. He put the bars in his pocket and went back to the living room with a bag of chips, offering some to his colleague.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Suddenly, the doorbell rang. The bald man put his finger to his lips again and nodded to his partner. The latter carefully put down the chips, went to the peephole, and froze. At one point, his body twitched slightly, then he slowly turned around with a look of complete bewilderment on his face. A crimson dot appeared on his forehead, from which blood began to flow. Lurching to one side, he fell dead to the floor. The bald man turned in confusion to the girl sitted in opposite, but instead her there was a suspect from the photo sitting with his legs crossed, smiling ominously at him. At that moment, the man suddenly woke up from what he had seen, finding himself on the same sofa, in front to the girl who was still looking at him, still tied up. Pistachio shells fell from the sofa.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - “Dude...?” - he said hoarsely to his partner.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - “What's up?” - he replied from the other room.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - “Where's my cortidrenaline, I'm falling asleep...”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - “How should I know? It's probably in the car...”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	The man looked at his watch, then at the girl, rubbed his nose lazily, and moved closer to her.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - “Did he go to the store to pick out furniture or what?”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	The girl shrugged. He grinned insolently and pulled out a knife:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - “Don't play with me, bitch...”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	Meanwhile, Curly was examining the bedroom. Despite the open window, the room felt stuffy. The bedroom was quite small, most of it taken up by a double bed. The rest of the space was occupied by a sturdy white wardrobe with vacuum doors made of thermoplastic, leaving a narrow passage to the dusty window. On the side hung a short shelf with photographs and an ashtray. He walked a little further and looked at them more closely, but there were no familiar faces there. It seemed strange that neither the girl nor the person they were actually looking for was there. The mercenary grunted, turned around, and opened the wardrobe door. Inside lay the curled-up body of the hacker.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - “Dude, something's wrong here...” - he began, heading back to the living room.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	At that moment, the girl quickly looked up at the man sitting in front. Her pupils dilated unnaturally. The man only managed to see a faint bluish glint in the girl's eyes before she tore the ropes binding her with a slight movement of her hands and, without getting up from her chair, brought them to his ears in a smooth semicircle. There was a faint electrical crackle, then she spat the gag right into his forehead and release him. The mercenary fell backward unconscious. At that moment, a second man appeared and, assessing the situation, reached for the weapon under his coat, but the young woman beat him to it—with a deft leap from her chair, she landed within arm's reach and simply touched his forehead with her index finger. Blood immediately flowed from his nose, and the curly-haired man collapsed nearby.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	The bald man woke up with a sob from another nightmare in the car. They were standing in the same place near the house, in front of them were the evening lights of the same street, dimmed by time. His friend was sleeping nearby, under the hissing crackle of the eomaga. The mixed visions made him feel dizzy.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	On a bench a few meters from the car, a pretty young lady in a red jacket sat with her thin finger pressed against the bulging point of the implant on her temple. Her eyes flashed a bluish hue, her pupils dilating sharply.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - “Lee!” - He nudged his colleague with his elbow. - “Wake up, damn...”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	His curly-haired friend did not respond. The car was dark so as not to attract unnecessary attention, but the sun had long since set and the height of the streetlights did not allow enough light to penetrate inside. He decided to turn on the light in the car and discovered that his partner had long since gone limp - a trickle of dried blood was visible from his nose. After unsuccessfully trying to rouse his friend, he suddenly froze when he noticed a girl sitting nearby stand up imposingly and walk past the car. It was her, - the same girl who had been in the apartment... As she passed by, she smiled at him and flirtatiously winked, pressing her finger to her lips.<br><br>



 <u><b>_ The morning of March 12. _ </u></b>
<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	The central building of UNERO's headquarters. Near the main entrance below, the familiar bald head of the mercenary appears. 	He stands there, looking appraisingly at the armored glass of the shiny skyscraper with a chrome tower at the top. Then he walks confidently forward, greets the security guard politely and goes inside. Calls the elevator and raises finger to his temple:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - “The suspect has been eliminated, boss. I'm at headquarters, on my way up to you.”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - “Glad to hear it, Mick... Excellent! So waiting for you in my office.”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	The bald man enters the elevator, selects the floor, and turns with face to the doors. His eyes appear black due to his dilated pupils, in which a faint blue glint can be seen, after which they begin to narrow.<br><br>
